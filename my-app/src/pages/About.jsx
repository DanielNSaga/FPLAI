                    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                        Our AI model, developed using Python, leverages machine learning to analyze vast amounts of historical FPL data. By examining metrics such as player performance, opponent difficulty, and team rankings, the AI provides accurate predictions on future player performances.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                        The model utilizes multiple advanced algorithms, including Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, combined in a stacking model. This approach maximizes prediction accuracy by harnessing the strengths of each algorithm. The predictions are processed by a Flask server and returned to the application to help you make informed decisions.

                        The backend of our application is built using Spring Boot, a powerful Java framework that handles the business logic, data management, and integration with the AI model. Hereâ€™s how it works:

                        <li><strong>Prediction Service:</strong> Interacts with the AI model to retrieve predictions and integrates them into the application.</li>
                        <li><strong>Transfer Optimization:</strong> Analyzes your team, suggests optimal transfers, and ensures compliance with FPL rules.</li>
                        <li><strong>Team Optimization:</strong> Automatically selects the best players within budget constraints to maximize points for upcoming gameweeks.</li>
