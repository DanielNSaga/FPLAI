# Fantasy Premier League Optimizer

## Overview

Unlock the full potential of your Fantasy Premier League (FPL) team with our advanced AI-driven optimizer. Designed to enhance your decision-making process, this tool provides precise and effortless team optimization.

## How the AI Model Works

Our AI model, developed in Python, harnesses machine learning to sift through extensive historical FPL data. By analyzing key metrics such as individual player performance, the difficulty level of upcoming opponents, and overall team standings, the AI delivers accurate predictions for future player performances.

### Advanced Algorithms

To achieve high prediction accuracy, the model employs a stacking approach that integrates multiple advanced algorithms:

- **Random Forest**
- **XGBoost**
- **LightGBM**
- **CatBoost**

This ensemble method leverages the unique strengths of each algorithm, resulting in more reliable predictions. A Flask server processes these predictions and feeds them back into the application, empowering you with actionable insights.

## Backend System Overview

The backend is built using Spring Boot, a powerful Java framework that manages the application's core functionalities, including business logic, data processing, and AI integration. Here's a breakdown of its key components:

- **Data Management**: Collects and processes data on players, teams, and fixtures from the official Fantasy Premier League API.
- **Prediction Service**: Interfaces with the AI model to obtain predictions and seamlessly integrates them into the application.
- **Transfer Optimization**: Evaluates your current team, recommends optimal transfers, and ensures all suggestions comply with FPL regulations.
- **Team Optimization**: Automatically selects the best players within your budget constraints to maximize points in upcoming gameweeks.

## Frontend System Overview

The frontend of the application is built with **React**, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The React frontend provides an interactive and user-friendly experience, allowing you to:

- **Visualize Data**: Display player statistics, team information, and fixture details in an intuitive format.
- **Manage Your Team**: Easily make transfers, adjust your lineup, and see the impact of potential changes.
- **Receive Predictions**: View AI-generated predictions and recommendations directly within the application.
- **Real-time Updates**: Get the latest data and predictions with seamless integration to the backend services.

## API Integration

The backend exposes a RESTful API to handle various operations essential for team optimization:

- **Fetching Data**: Retrieves the most recent player, team, and fixture information from external sources.
- **Interacting with the AI Model**: Sends relevant data to the Flask server and receives prediction results.
- **Optimizing Teams**: Processes team data using the latest predictions to suggest the most effective transfers and lineup adjustments.

The React frontend communicates with this API to provide a dynamic and responsive user experience.

## Why Use This Optimizer?

By combining the robust backend capabilities of Spring Boot with a sophisticated Python-based AI model and an interactive React frontend, this application offers a comprehensive toolkit for serious FPL managers. Whether you're aiming to fine-tune your existing squad or strategize impactful transfers, our system is designed to help you make informed decisions and achieve success in your league.
